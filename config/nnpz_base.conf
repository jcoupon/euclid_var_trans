#                        Reference Sample Section
#
# The Reference Sample Section handles the configuration related with the
# objects used to find neighbors from. Two different types of reference samples
# can be used. The first is a directory build using the NNPZ tools, containing
# the reference sample in the NNPZ format (parameter reference_sample_dir_. The
# second is a reference catalog, containing photometry values for the same bands
# as the target catalog (ref_cat option). Note that only one of the two options
# can be used.

#       by the NnpzBuildPhotometry tool
# - reference_sample_phot_filters

#                       Target Catalog Section
#
# The Target Catalog Section handles the configuration related with the catalog
# to compute the photometric redshift for.
#
# Target catalog options:
#
# - target_catalog
#       The input photometric catalog, in FITS or ASCII format
# - target_catalog_filters
#       The columns of the target catalog containing the photometry values. They
#       must have the same order defined by the reference_catalog_filters option
# - target_catalog_gal_ebv
#       The two columns of the target catalog containing the E(B-V) and E(B-V) error
# - target_catalog_filters_mean
#       A dictionary where the key is the band name, and the value is the column on the
#       target catalog containing the average wavelength of the part of the filter that
#       influenced the measure.
# - missing_photometry_flags
#       A list containing all the values indicating missing data. Note that NaN
#       is implicitly translated to missing data.
# - input_size
#       Defines the number of rows of the input catalog to process

#                     NNPZ Algorithm Options Section
#
# This section contains the options related with the NNPZ algorithm configuration.
#
# Neighbors selection options:
#
# - neighbor_method
#       The method to be used for selecting the neighbors. It can be one of:
#       - KDTree: Fastest method, finding the neighbors using Euclidean distance.
#           WARNING: All errors are ignored when this method is used.
#       - BruteForce: Finds the neighbors using chi2 distance, by computing the
#           chi2 of all objects in the reference sample. WARNING: This method
#           is much slower than the alternatives.
#       - Combined: This method first finds a batch of neighbors in Euclidean
#           distance using a KDTree and then it finds the closest neighbors inside
#           the batch, by using chi2 distance.
# - neighbors_no
#       The number of neighbors to be used
# - batch_size
#       The size of the batch size when the 'Combined' method is used
#
# Weight calculation options:
#
# - weight_method
#       The method to be used for computing the weights of the neighbors. It can
#       be one of:
#       - Euclidean: The inversed Euclidean distance (errors are ignored)
#       - Chi2: The inversed chi2
#       - Likelihood: The likelihood computed as exp(-chi2 / 2)
# - weight_method_alternative
#       If weight_method yields a value of 0 for *all* neighbors of a given object,
#       this method will be used instead to recompute alternative weights.
#       It supports the same values as weight_method

#                      Output Section
#
# The Output Section handles the configuration related with the produced output.
#
# Avaiable options:
#
# - output_file
#       The file to store the output catalog
# - copy_input_columns
#       If True, the target catalog columns are copied to the output
#       If False, at least 'target_catalog_id_column' is copied to the output
# - neighbor_info_output
#       Add to the output catalog the reference sample neighbor IDs and weights
# - pdz_quantiles
#       A list with the PDZ quantiles to be added to the output
# - pdz_mc_samples
#       The number of Monte Carlo samples to get from the PDZ for each source
# - flags_in_separate_columns
#       When True, the catalog will contain a column for each flag. When False,
#       the flags wil be compressed by 8 per column.
